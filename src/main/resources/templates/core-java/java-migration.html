<h1>Steps to Upgrade Java Version in a Legacy System</h1>

<h2>1. Analyze the Current System</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Start by understanding the current environment, the existing Java version, and dependencies. Ensure you know which applications are relying on Java and how tightly coupled they are to the current version.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify the current Java version.</li>
    <li>Check which parts of the system depend on Java.</li>
    <li>Identify any third-party libraries that may be incompatible with the new version.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Check Java Version Compatibility</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Not all Java versions are backward compatible, especially when upgrading from an older version (e.g., Java 7 to Java 17). Review the release notes of the target Java version and look for deprecations and incompatible changes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Examine the official Java release notes for features that may have been removed or changed.</li>
    <li>Evaluate whether your legacy system relies on deprecated or removed features.</li>
    <li>Check for syntax or behavioral changes in the new Java version.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Upgrade Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Many legacy systems rely on third-party libraries that may no longer be compatible with newer versions of Java. Check for updated versions of these libraries that support the new Java version.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Update or replace incompatible libraries.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all dependencies are Java version compatible.</li>
    <li>Test dependency integration thoroughly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Modify Build Scripts and Configuration Files</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Update your build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle, Ant) and configuration files to target the new Java version. Modify any scripts or environment settings to point to the new Java path.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Update Java version in build scripts (e.g., Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle).</li>
    <li>Ensure environment variables like <code>JAVA_HOME</code> are set to the new version.</li>
    <li>Update any shell scripts or batch files that rely on the Java executable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Refactor Code for Compatibility</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> If the codebase uses deprecated or removed features, it will need refactoring. For example, APIs or methods that were removed in the new Java version will need replacement.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search the codebase for deprecated or removed APIs.</li>
    <li>Refactor to use newer APIs where necessary.</li>
    <li>Optimize for new features of the target Java version.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Conduct Extensive Testing</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Run all unit tests, integration tests, and system tests to ensure that the application behaves as expected with the new Java version. Performance testing is also essential, as newer Java versions might bring performance improvements or changes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Run automated unit tests to catch syntax or logic issues.</li>
    <li>Perform integration and system testing to ensure proper application functionality.</li>
    <li>Check performance benchmarks to detect potential bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Monitor in Staging Environment</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Deploy the system in a staging environment to monitor how it performs under conditions that mimic the production environment. Monitor for any performance regressions or compatibility issues.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deploy the application to a staging or test environment.</li>
    <li>Monitor application logs and resource usage.</li>
    <li>Validate that all features work as expected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Roll Out in Production</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Once the upgrade has been validated in the staging environment, schedule the production rollout. Ensure you have rollback plans in case issues arise.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deploy to production during a scheduled maintenance window.</li>
    <li>Monitor application logs closely after deployment.</li>
    <li>Have a rollback plan in case of critical issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Post-Upgrade Monitoring</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> After the upgrade, continue to monitor the system for any unforeseen issues or performance degradation. Ensure users and stakeholders are satisfied with the system's performance post-upgrade.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor application behavior over time.</li>
    <li>Collect feedback from users and stakeholders.</li>
    <li>Address any issues promptly.</li>
</ul>
